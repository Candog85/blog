# 8 Years of Coding: Recounting My Journey

As a developer who is now certified in HTML and CSS, it’s strange to look back at where I’ve started and how and to realize just how bad I was at coding. There was a time where my idea of coding was dragging blocks of instructions together. There was a point in which I didn’t even know what a programming language was. I didn’t know just how important coding would be to me.

My first experience with coding was in my 4th grade STEAM class. We used Scratch to follow along with a lesson plan to make prebuilt little games.

It was really fun, I enjoyed the challenge of having to figure out how to solve a problem using a limited set of instructions. I think it became my favorite aspect of programming, having to solve a problem and seeing the result all come together at once.

After that we moved on to some "coding games". They were basically just scratch styled, using prebuilt commands to solve problems. Lightbot and CodeCombat are the first that come to mind. They combined problem solving and video games, two things that resonated with me.

After heading into middle school, my focus shifted to more important things. Academics started to become more important. I just couldn’t afford to focus on what seemed to be more of a hobby. That was until the start of the pandemic.

Not having to physically commute to school gave me a lot more free time. Mostly to procrastinate and watch YouTube between classes, but also to rediscover my love for coding. One day after classes had ended, I got curious and looked up “free coding lessons” and the first thing that popped up was a free CodeCademy course on Javascript.

I started from the basics, learning the differences between data types, basic functions like console logging, and doing arithmetic through Javascript. After the free trial lessons had concluded, I decided to go off on my own and try to create my own website from scratch.

There was a lot I needed to learn, at that point I didn’t even know what HTML was. Anything that I didn’t know how to do I would have to look up. It took me actual days to add the most basic elements, like adding images. It was a difficult and slow process, but I still found it fun, having to figure everything out. Stack overflow also helped a lot. It was really cool to see that for any problem I was facing, somebody else had already faced.

Unfortunately, the website was lost after changing computers, as I never backed up the files I used, but it was still a valuable introduction to real world programming.

Once again, as High-school approached, I had lost interest in coding as a hobby in favor of my academics again. But then entering high school I began to consider programming not as a hobby, but as a career. And when I got accepted into a computer science college course through the CollegeNow program, it was an exciting prospect.

We learned the concept of pseudocode, the idea that code could be planned out in a universal and simplified way. It changed the way I would go about
