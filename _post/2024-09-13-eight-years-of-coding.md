# 8 Years of Coding: Recounting My Journey

As a developer who is now certified in HTML and CSS, it’s strange to look back at where I’ve started and how and to realize just how bad I was at coding. There was a time where my idea of coding was dragging blocks of instructions together. There was a point in which I didn’t even know what a programming language was. I didn’t know just how important coding would be to me.

My first experience with coding was in my 4th grade STEAM class. We used Scratch to follow along with a lesson plan to make prebuilt little games.

It was really fun, I enjoyed the challenge of having to figure out how to solve a problem using a limited set of instructions. I think it became my favorite aspect of programming, having to solve a problem and seeing the result all come together at once.

After that we moved on to some "coding games". They were basically just scratch styled, using prebuilt commands to solve problems. Lightbot and CodeCombat are the first that come to mind. They combined problem solving and video games, two things that resonated with me.

After heading into middle school, my focus shifted to more important things. Academics started to become more important. I just couldn’t afford to focus on what seemed to be more of a hobby. That was until the start of the pandemic.

Not having to physically commute to school gave me a lot more free time. Mostly to procrastinate and watch YouTube between classes, but also to rediscover my love for coding. One day after classes had ended, I got curious and looked up “free coding lessons” and the first thing that popped up was a free CodeCademy course on Javascript.

I started from the basics, learning the differences between data types, basic functions like console logging, and doing arithmetic through Javascript. After the free trial lessons had concluded, I decided to go off on my own and try to create my own website from scratch.

There was a lot I needed to learn, at that point I didn’t even know what HTML was. Anything that I didn’t know how to do I would have to look up. It took me actual days to add the most basic elements, like adding images. It was a difficult and slow process, but I still found it fun, having to figure everything out. Stack overflow also helped a lot. It was really cool to see that for any problem I was facing, somebody else had already faced.

Unfortunately, the website was lost after changing computers, as I never backed up the files I used, but it was still a valuable introduction to real world programming.

Once again, as High-school approached, I had lost interest in coding as a hobby in favor of my academics again. But then entering high school I began to consider programming not as a hobby, but as a career. And when I got accepted into a computer science college course through the CollegeNow program, it was an exciting prospect.

We learned the concept of pseudocode, the idea that code could be planned out in a universal and simplified way. Our class in particular used physical flowcharts to represent our code. It changed the way I approached code, teaching me to plan methodically instead of working on the fly towards a vague goal.

It was also my introduction to Python, which quickly became my favorite language. It was very logic heavy, with an emphasis on math and calculations. For my final project I created one big “Airport Calculator” script that calculated the profits and airport made from a ton of factors.

The script took me a week to make, culminating in a 4 hour session of tweaking and debugging the night before it was due. Despite the amount of work I had to do in that class, I still enjoyed it. It certainly wasn't easy work, but it's work that intrigued me, that held my attention in a way that most other kinds of work couldn't do.

Since Junior year, I've been learning Full-Stack Development from Mr. Forlenza through my time at the Brooklyn STEAM Center. Learning HTML and CSS last year forced me to pay more attention to the aesthetics of what I develop. Instead of solving logical issues, I had to create projects that also focused on user fidelity and ease of use. And adding JavaScript on top of that, I was finally creating projects that looked good (to me at least) and could finally have a visual medium to express my development skills.

With the help of my teachers and peers, last year I was able to earn my IT Specialist: HTML and CSS IT certification. And this year, I hope to earn My IT Specialist: Python certification this year as well. It's been a long journey of coding, but it's nowhere near done just yet. I still have to hone my skills on what I know, and there's a lot more I want to explore in this field. But that will come, all in due time.
