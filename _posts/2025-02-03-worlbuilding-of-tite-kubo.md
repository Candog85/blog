# Interconnectivity and the Worldbuilding of Tite Kubo
### *(Spoilers for the Bleach manga and all related media)*

In my free time, I am very interested in the process of worldbuilding. It’s a hobby  I do not talk about much, but I indulge in creating my own worlds and stories at my leisure. And one of my greatest inspirations is the world crafted by the critically acclaimed mangaka Tite Kubo in his Bleach series. Kubo’s writing philosophy is akin to that of other mangaka like Echira Oda, creator of one piece, in which almost every story element is related to another in some way, shape, or form. Interconnectivity is essential to worldbuilding, as finding these connections makes the world feel vibrant, alive, and palpable.

My favorite example of Kubo’s utilization of interconnectedness in the world of Bleach is that of the main antagonist of the extended Can’t Fear Your Own World (CFYOW) light novel, Tokinada Tsunayashiro. Although he is a character introduced far after the events of the original manga, his importance and influence of Tokinada can be seen over a decade’s worth of storytelling prior.

Kaname Tosen was a character introduced in the titular Soul Society arc in the earliest days of the manga. The main motivation for both his desire to become a soul reaper as well as the betrayal of the soul society he swore to protect is the death of his best friend at the hands of a corrupt nobleman. After his introduction, betrayal of the protagonists, and eventual untimely death, Tosen is a character that seemingly fades into obscurity in the zeitgeist of both the world of Bleach itself as well as the minds of the readers. And yet, in an excellent literary move, Tokinada’s introduction not only gives a new perspective on the story of Tosen, but serves as a reintroduction of a relatively forgotten character, and brings his storyline back into the spotlight making it ever-more relevant.

During his introduction, it is revealed that Tokinada is the husband and murderer of Tosen’s slain friend. Connecting this new character to events of the past serves two simultaneous purposes. One is to provide context to the events of the past; the circumstances behind Tosen’s backstory had been left intentionally vague, and introducing Tokinada would allow Kubo to expand upon the story of Tosen. Secondly, it provides a literary stepping stone for the introduction of a new plotline; the light novels themselves follow Tosen’s prodigy, Shuhei Hisagi, as he struggles to navigate his duties as a soul reaper after his sensei’s death. This ultimately culminates in a confrontation between Hisagi and Tokinada, a concept that would be devoid of significance without its connection to the events of the past. Tosen’s story could have ended where it did, with his death. And yet, Kubo not only connects his story to events that occur far after his death but integrates an entirely new story developed alongside it.

Interconnectivity in a fictional world also serves an important function in the characterization of those who reside in it. Hence, my second favorite display of the interconnected world of Bleach lies quite literally within the main character, Ichigo Kurosaki. That is the mystery of “Old Man Zangetsu” and how Kubo takes a seemingly simple attempt to bring an air of mystery to a character and turns it into a pivotal detail that foreshadows the nature of Ichigo as a whole and the conclusion of his journey of self-discovery.

Ichigo is introduced to us as a normal human with an unassuming past who gains the powers of a soul reaper after meeting his first mentor, Rukia. As he continues his training and becomes more in touch with his soul he manifests his spiritual abilities as a spiritual being known colloquially as "Old Man Zangetsu". Zangetsu becomes a significant mentor in Ichigo’s journey, and yet his abilities and mannerisms hint that something about him is not normal.

One significant hint is the motif of shadows within this manifestation of Zangetsu. Besides his physical design, being a character practically shrouded in shadow, Zangetsu showcases a few shadow-based abilities that feel incredibly out of place for a character meant to represent Ichigo’s soul. And in one particularly strange panel, Zangetsu’s true name is literally censored with a black box of shadows.

His behaviors and attitude towards Ichigo are also something to note. Old Man Zangetsu is particularly protective of Ichigo, acting towards him almost in a paternalistic manner. However, in contrast, Zangetsu has bouts of melodrama and thoughtfulness, implying that throughout his guiding of Ichigo, there is something he knows that he is refusing to reveal.

By the final arc of the Bleach manga, we understand that Zangetsu is not a cumulative representation of Ichigo’s abilities, but rather only a third that derives from him being born a Quincy, a race of powerful spiritual beings. Therefore the being we know as Old Man Zangetsu is in reality, meant to represent the leader of the Quincies and the one from which all Quincy abilities are derived, Yhwach

Immediately the stark resemblance between Old Man Zangetsu and Yhwach is obvious, implying a fundamental connection between the two characters. Old Man Zangetsu’s manipulation of shadows is an ability unique to Quincies that we see in other Quincies such as his ancestor Yhwach. His strange and almost bipolar nature is due to his desire to protect Ichigo clashing with him deceiving him of his true nature, and creating complex emotions that are revealed through Zangetsu’s many speeches. Finally, the censoring of his name earlier in the manga is an attempt by the soul reapers to seal the abilities and influence of the all-powerful Yhwach, even his name holds great power within the continuity of Bleach. As a personal anecdote, this last detail is my favorite aspect about Ichigo and his abilities. Such a strange detail being masterfully connected to Ichigo’s identity is impressive, and in hindsight is a very cool addition to his characterization.

Like Tokinada’s introduction, this reveal has implications that span throughout the entirety of Kubo’s world. Once again, Old Man Zangetsu could have been left behind as a relic of the past, as the common shonen tropes of power creep introduce new abilities and manifestations of Ichigo’s abilities that leave him behind. However, a very purposeful reintroduction of this character builds an interwoven web of story elements that makes the world feel genuine and candid as if these characters are living real lives of their own. As an amateur worldbuilder, I strive to incorporate even a fraction of the interconnectedness of Tite Kubo’s vibrant world of Bleach.
